# DAA
This repository contains the programs which I implemented during my learning of design and analysis of algorithm

## Running steps 

- cd into the directory where you've cloned the programs 

- Make sure you have c++ compiler installed. To check the same type g++ in cmd and it should give error to specify the name.

- To compile type g++ -o <output-program-name> <program-name>.cpp

- To run the same program type <output-program-name>

- The program should run.
